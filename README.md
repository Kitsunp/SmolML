# SmolML

A pure Python machine learning library built entirely from scratch for educational purposes, focusing on transparency and understanding over performance.

## Overview

SmolML implements a fully functional machine learning library using only `collections`, `random` and `math` modules. While not optimized for production use, it serves as an excellent educational tool for understanding machine learning fundamentals through hands-on implementation.

## Features

- N-dimensional Arrays
- Autograd Engine
- Scalers
- Optimizers
- Weight Initializers
- Functions
    - Loss functions
    - Activation functions
- ML Models
    - Regression
        - Linear
        - Polynomic
    - Neural Networks
    - Decission Tree
    - Random Forest

## Purpose

- Learning ML concepts from the ground up
- Every component is built from first principles
- Uses only basic Python libraries
- Includes all essential components for ML experiments

## Limitations

- Not optimized for large-scale problems
- Performance is constrained by pure Python implementation
- Suitable for small experiments rather than production use
